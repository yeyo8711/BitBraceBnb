# BitBraceBnb (BBB)
A demo of our dapp that helps homeowners, and those who wish they had a home to rent and make passive income.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background:
A lot of people wish they had a home to rent (kind of like airBnb) but do not have the capital for it.

## Solution:
Our hypothetical company buys older homes, remodels them, and sets them up to be semi-automated for renting in days.
We have a marketplace that has beautiful homes which have the capacity to host guests in which users can buy a percentage of the home, or the entire home if they wish. Once the home is fully purchased, it is rented out and provides an income for the "owners" which is distributed monthly, minus the cost of our service for keeping it functional. 

## How It Works
1. Homeowners attend our office where we purchase their homes and provide all the legal services to gain possesion of their homes. 
2. Homes are then remodeled and furnished to be able to host multiple guests semi automated. They do almost everything self-served the only person that goes to the home is a cleaning person which takes care of almost everything.
3. The homes are then posted on our marketplace and divided up into "units" depending on the size and price of it, which can be purchased by anyone on the **polygon**  blockchain using their metamask wallet.
4. Before the home is sold out, users can opt out and get back their funds. However once the home is fully bought, users are locked in for a year. During this year they will let their investment give them passive returns through rent. After the year they can sell their share on the marketpalce and the opportunity to make extra cash for doing so.
5. All of this is done through ***Smart Contracts*** so users can have the confidence that there is no middleman touching the funds. The buying and selling of shares and also the rent is all paid through a SC.
